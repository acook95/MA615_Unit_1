## How a student of Guinness became ‘the Faraday of statistics’

<p style="font-size:18px">
Gosset was born in Canterbury in 1876, into an old Huguenot family. He studied chemistry and mathematics in Oxford, graduating in 1899, with first-class honours in both subjects. He then joined Guinness in Dublin as a chemist, and worked at the brewery on James’s Street for 36 years, before becoming head brewer at a new Guinness brewery at Park Royal in London.
